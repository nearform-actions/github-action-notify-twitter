## Example usage

The example below runs when the release is published and also allows to trigger the action manually.

```yml
name: Notify twitter

on:
  workflow_dispatch:
  release:
    types: [published]

jobs:
  setup:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: nearform-actions/github-action-notify-twitter@master
        with:
          message: |
            ${{ github.event.repository.name }} ${{ github.event.release.tag_name }} has been released. Check out the release notes: ${{ github.event.release.html_url }}
          twitter-app-key: ${{ secrets.TWITTER_APP_KEY }}
          twitter-app-secret: ${{ secrets.TWITTER_APP_SECRET }}
          twitter-access-token: ${{ secrets.TWITTER_ACCESS_TOKEN }}
          twitter-access-token-secret: ${{ secrets.TWITTER_ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET }}

```

You can add media (image, GIF or video) to your post using the `media` parameter. This refers to the path of an image within the repository.
The Twitter API currently supports a maximum of four media elements.
For images and GIFs, you can also add an alt text using the `media-alt-text` parameter. This parameter is also a list and maintains the structure of the `media` parameter. So if you want to add an alt text only to the second content you have to write it in the second position of the list leaving the previous ones empty.

```yml
name: Notify twitter

on:
  workflow_dispatch:
  release:
    types: [published]

jobs:
  setup:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: nearform-actions/github-action-notify-twitter@master
        with:
          message: |
            ${{ github.event.repository.name }} ${{ github.event.release.tag_name }} has been released. Check out the release notes: ${{ github.event.release.html_url }}
          twitter-app-key: ${{ secrets.TWITTER_APP_KEY }}
          twitter-app-secret: ${{ secrets.TWITTER_APP_SECRET }}
          twitter-access-token: ${{ secrets.TWITTER_ACCESS_TOKEN }}
          twitter-access-token-secret: ${{ secrets.TWITTER_ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET }}
          media: |
            ./video.mp4
            ./twitter-x.png
            ./twitter-x.png
          media-alt-text: |
            
            alt icon 1
            alt icon 2
```
